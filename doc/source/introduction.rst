Compiling the system
====================

The port was prepared using Gentoo and Debian Linux environments.
The procedures described here should also work on other systems, but if you detect any errors or ommissions please e-mail us at `contact@antmicro.com <mailto:contact@antmicro.com>`_.

Prerequisites
-------------

Toolchain
~~~~~~~~~

The toolchain used to compile the kernel is Sourcery G++ Lite 2011.03-42, and can be obtained from `the Mentor Graphics website <https://sourcery.mentor.com/sgpp/lite/arm/portal/release1802>`_.

When this was written, Sourcery G++ Lite was directly available without the need for logging in using a direct link:

.. code-block:: bash

   wget 'https://sourcery.mentor.com/sgpp/lite/arm/portal/package8736/public'\
   '/arm-none-eabi/arm-2011.03-42-arm-none-eabi.bin'
   chmod +x arm-2011.03-42-arm-none-eabi.bin
   ./arm-2011.03-42-arm-none-eabi.bin

.. warning::

   The installer for the toolchain does not cope with dash as the system shell, however instructions how to get around that should be printed out when the installer is run. 

The toolchain should be decompressed and its :file:`bin` directory included in the PATH variable.
The proper availability of the toolchain can be checked by finding out if ``arm-none-eabi-gcc`` is available from the shell.

``repo``
~~~~~~~~

The ``repo`` tool, used to manipulate the Android git repositories, can be downloaded from Google's repositories and made available in your system as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir ~/bin
   PATH=~/bin:$PATH
   curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
   chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

Java
~~~~

The Java JDK 1.6 is required for Android compilation.
Oracle JDK 1.6 installer might not be available in your system's package manager.
In this case, get the latest version of the Java SE Development Kit from the `Oracle website <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase6-419409.html>`_.
In the file list accept the license and download the ``.bin`` file for your system (Linux x86 or Linux x86).
This step requires logging in.

Instructions to install the package named ``jdk-6u45-linux-x64.bin`` downloaded to the ``~/downloads`` directory are:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ~
   chmod +x ~/downloads/jdk-6u45-linux-x64.bin
   ~/downloads/jdk-6u45-linux-x64.bin

The package is unpacked to the ``~/jdk1.6.0_45`` directory.

Other packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A number of other dependencies are also required, but these should be available from package managers on most systems without a problem - e.g. on Debian 7.0 (Wheezy) you can get them by typing:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt-get install lzop uboot-mkimage bison xsltproc zip flex
 
Building the Linux kernel
-------------------------

You will need to compile your Android-enabled kernel separately.
You can base your configuration on https://github.com/antmicro/enclustra_zynq_linux/raw/master/config_enclustra_android.

To compile the 3.13 kernel from our repository:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/antmicro/enclustra_zynq_linux.git
   cp config_enclustra_android .config
   CROSS_COMPILE="arm-none-eabi-" ARCH=arm make uImage -j$(nproc)
   
Getting the Android sources
---------------------------

The sources are fetched using the ``repo`` tool:

.. code-block:: bash

   repo init -u git://github.com/antmicro/android_mars_zx3 -b master
   repo sync -f # use -f to ignore fetch errors

.. warning::

   Before starting this procedure, be aware that it may take a long time, especially if you are running on a slow Internet connection!

Building Android
----------------

Android can now be compiled using your Java installation.
Be sure to supply the correct path to the JDK.

.. code-block:: bash

   source ./build/envsetup.sh
   export JAVA_HOME=$HOME/jdk1.6.0_45  # path to the JDK installed before
   export ANDROID_JAVA_HOME=$JAVA_HOME
   export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
   lunch mars_zx3-userdebug
   make -j$(nproc)

Additional boot files
---------------------

To boot Android on the device, you will need some additional files:

* devicetree.dtb
* system_top.bin

To download them, use command:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/antmicro/boot_files_mars_zx3.git

Creating an SD Card with the system
===================================

To boot Android on the device you have to use at least a 512 MB SD Card. The system needs four partitions: 

* for the kernel image and related files (vfat, 32 MB)
* root partition (ext4, 32 MB)
* system (ext4, 256 MB)
* data (ext4, 100 MB or more)

The last partition, used to store user data and additional applications, will be formatted to take up the remaining space on the SD card.

Preparing the card
------------------

.. warning::

   All data on the card will be lost. :file:`/dev/sdX` below is used as the card device node.

Insert the card into reader and create partitions with the following commands (lines beginning with a colon are typed inside the ``fdisk`` command prompt, without the colon):

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo fdisk /dev/sdX
   : o [enter]
   : n [enter] [enter] [enter] [enter] +32M [enter]
   : n [enter] [enter] [enter] [enter] +32M [enter]
   : n [enter] [enter] [enter] [enter] +256M [enter]
   : n [enter] p [enter] [enter] [enter]
   : w [enter]

   mkfs.vfat -n BOOT /dev/sdX1
   mkfs.ext4 -L root /dev/sdX2
   mkfs.ext4 -L system /dev/sdX3
   mkfs.ext4 -L data /dev/sdX4

Copying files
-------------

.. note::

   ``$KERNEL``, ``$ANDROID``, and ``$BOOTFILES`` used below are respectively: the kernel and Android sources main directories paths, and path to additional boot files (system_top.bin and devicetree.dtb)

If the compilation was successful, the rootfs CPIO image is located at :file:`$ANDROID/out/target/product/mars_zx3/ramdisk.img`, and the system partition at :file:`$ANDROID/out/target/product/mars_zx3/system.img`.
The compiled kernel image is at :file:`$KERNEL/arch/arm/boot/uImage`.

To install files on the card, run the following commands as root:

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir -p /mnt/android/{img,boot,root,system}
   mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/android/boot
   mount /dev/sdX2 /mnt/android/root
   mount /dev/sdX3 /mnt/android/system
   mount -o loop $ANDROID/out/target/product/mars_zx3/system.img /mnt/android/img

   cp $KERNEL/arch/arm/boot/{uImage} /mnt/android/boot
   cp $BOOTFILES/{devicetree.dtb,system_top.bit} /mnt/android/boot

   rsync -av /mnt/android/img/* /mnt/android/system
   cd /mnt/android/root
   gunzip -c $ANDROID/out/target/product/mars_zx3/ramdisk.img | cpio -i
   chmod +x *.sh

   cd /
   umount /mnt/android/{img,boot,root,system}

Booting
=======

To boot Android on the device you have to install U-Boot first.
Sources and build instructions can be found at the `U-Boot website <http://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot>`_.

U-Boot environment
------------------

After successfull U-Boot installation, connect the USB cable to the micro USB port and run a serial terminal program, for example ``picocom``:

.. code-block:: bash
   picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0

In the U-Boot command prompt type the following commands to set environment variables:

.. code-block:: bash

   setenv bootargs console=ttyPS0,115200 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw rootwait earlyprintk
   setenv bootcmd mmcinfo && fatload mmc 0 0x3000000 uImage && \
   fatload mmc 0 0x2A00000 devicetree.dtb && \
   fatload mmc 0 0x200000 system_top.bit && fpga loadb 0 0x200000 ${filesize} && \
   bootm 0x3000000 - 0x2A00000
   saveenv

And to boot:

.. code-block:: bash

   boot

Using a USB WiFi dongle
=======================

By default, only WiFi interfaces based on Atheros AR9271 are supported.
Simply connect the dongle to the USB port and go to the Android settings, where you can turn on WiFi.

Hints on adding support for other interfaces
--------------------------------------------

To use other interfaces, you have to turn on the required interface's driver in the kernel config, rebuild it, and optionally put its firmware in the ``etc/firmware`` directory on the system partition.
For detailed information which driver and firmware to use, google for its name or ID, which can be obtained with the ``lsusb`` command.
The `Linux Wireless <http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/>`_ page is a good place to start.
